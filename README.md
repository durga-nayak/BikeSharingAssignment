## General Information
- Problem Statement
US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands
At the end to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features.
